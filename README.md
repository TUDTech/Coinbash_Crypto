## Usage

To get the basic information on the top 10 cryptocurrencies ranked by their market cap, simply enter
```
$ coinbash.sh
```

## Options

There are many options. Please run `coinbash.sh --help` to see them all. 
You can use the `-f` (or `--fiat`) followed by a currency symbol to get the prices in your local currency, crypto, or metal ounces.
* The default currency is USD.
* It supports crypto currencies: BTC, ETH, USDT, XRP, BCH, BNB, DOT, LINK, CRO, BSV, LTC.

```
$ coinbash.sh -f BTC # get prices in BTC (Bitcoin)
$ coinbash.sh -f AUD # get prices in Australian Dollars
$ coinbash.sh -f XAU # get prices in Gold ounces
```

`-e` or `--eur` is a shortcut for Euros, a shortcut for `-f EUR`. 

```
$ coinbash.sh -e # get prices in Euros
```

Use `-n` or `--top` followed by a number to get the top _n_ crypto currencies, ranked by their market cap. 

```
$ coinbash.sh -n 12 # get information on the top 12 crypto currencies
```

You can use the `-l` (or `--listbysymbols`) with coin symbol to search cryptocurrencies by their symbols. Add symbols seperated by commas. 

```
$ coinbash.sh -l btc,eth,ltc # get information for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC)
```

You can use the `-i` (or `--listbynames`) with coin name to search cryptocurrencies by their names. Add names seperated by commas.

```
$ coinbash.sh -i bitcoin-cash,ethereum-classic # lists Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC)
```

You can use the `-h` (or `--help`) to get help and to see all available options as well as examples.

```
$ coinbash.sh -h # get help
```

Help returns the following
